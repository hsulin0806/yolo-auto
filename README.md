<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


We realised that training custom object detectors can be hard and really tiring. Creators haven't ever taken the step to making custom object detectors easy for all. YOLO-AUTO is an evolving libarary. We provide two liner code to create custom object detectors

Why?
* Your
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:


### Built With/On

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/)
* [GitPython](https://pypi.org/project/GitPython/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started to create some awesome object detectors.

### Installation
 
1. Pip install the package
```sh
pip install yolo-auto
```
2. Gather Data and place in a repository
```sh
data/labels
data/images
```




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This is the only amount of code you need to write:

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_


```sh
from yolo_auto.yolov3auto import Yolov3Train

x = Yolov3Train("/Users/arjunpandey/Desktop/AI-Stuff/test/labels/","/Users/arjunpandey/Desktop/AI-Stuff/test/images/",1,['LicensePlate'],"/Users/arjunpandey/Desktop/AI-Stuff/test/")
x.train()
```
